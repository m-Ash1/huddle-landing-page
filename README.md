## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge sharpen my skills in flexbox and positioning of the element on it and it is a good practice on responsive designs

### Continued development

I will practice more on making width and height of the elements with percentages not pixels to make my design be more confortable when
making it responsive on different screen and save a lot of time resizing elements
also I will try using the grid system to build the layout of the page. I will search more on grid and practice more on using flexbox.
